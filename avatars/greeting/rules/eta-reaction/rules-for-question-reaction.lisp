; The rules defined in this file contain reactions to specific gist clause questions from the user, in the form of either
; subschemas to instantiate or direct templatic outputs. Note that, in general, GPT-3 generation will be able to
; handle response generation in cases where a specific reaction is not selected here, so these rules are mainly
; used for subschema selection.
