; Blocks world conversation. An expected blocks world dialogue consists
; of the agent repeatedly asking the user if they have a spatial question
; to ask, followed by a question from the user, followed by an appropriate
; response by the agent. This repeats until the user says something interpreted
; as a goodbye, and is possibly preempted by some "smalltalk" questions
; (currently disabled).
