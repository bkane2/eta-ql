; Blocks world structure building instruction; such a session is expected to
; consist of the agent (given a goal representation) instructing the user on
; the steps required to create that goal representation, giving corrections
; to the user when they make an incorrect move, possibly answering user
; questions along the way, and terminating once the goal representation
; is successfully created.
