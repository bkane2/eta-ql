; Blocks world action supervision; consists of the BW agent listening for any
; questions (or other requests) by the user, watching them try to make a move
; towards the goal structure (possibly followed by a follow-up like "is that
; correct?"), and issuing a correction in the case that the user's action isn't
; an instance of ?ka1. The correction simply entails vocalizing ?ka1 with
; corrective phrasing (however, this is suppressed in the case where ?ka1
; involves undoing the previous action, since the user may technically get
; undoing something "wrong" if they don't move a block to exactly the original
; location, but this usually isn't actually an issue in need of correction).
