; Blocks world action instruction; consists of the BW agent guiding the
; user through making a specific action (e.g., a block move). Consists of
; monitoring the user's actions, and checking whether the user's action is
; an instance of ?ka1; otherwise, the agent should issue a correction. The
; agent should allow for the possibility of a question, pause request, or
; termination request during this process as well.

  ; David proposes the action to the user.

  ; The system tries to guide the user
  ; through a move until they do it successfully.
  ; TODO: if this should be more flexible, i.e. giving the user the power
  ; to 'suggest' or try a different move (for instance, if multiple valid
  ; paths exist towards the goal), the schema will need to be revised.

    ; The user responds to the proposal (could be silent acknowledgement).
    ; TODO: in principle, a response could be anything, potentially subsuming
    ; the "try to do move" action below. For now, I keep these separate.

    ; TODO: I'm unsure here as to whether corrections to the user (in the case
    ; that they make a wrong move) should be handled as a separate episode
    ; in the schema (as in the commented section below), or if they should
    ; be handled "implicitly" by the next planner proposal, as is the case
    ; currently.
