;; *discuss-activities*: development version 5 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
;;
;; After defining *discuss-activities*, we create a hash table 
;;       *output-semantics* 
;; containing interpretations of Lissa outputs, under hash keys 
;; like (*discuss-activities* ?e1). The main goal is to be able later
;; to match certain user inputs to question interpretations, to
;; see if the inputs already answer the questions, making them
;; redundant.
