;; *discuss-home*: development version 5 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
;;
;; After defining *discuss-home*, we create a hash table 
;;       *output-semantics* 
;; containing interpretations of Lissa outputs, under hash keys 
;; like (*discuss-home* ?e1). The main goal is to be able later
;; to match certain user inputs to question interpretations, to
;; see if the inputs already answer the questions, making them
;; redundant.

; LISSA introduces herself, sets the scene, asks about the user's 
; major, responds to the user's reply, and starts the "Rochester"
; part of the dialog.

; In future, I expect something closer to the following for the
; initial LISSA dialog schema; the acions would be matched and 
; elaborated into text by a language generator:
;  (^me explain-to.v ^you ((nnp lissa) ((nn dialog) framework.n)))
;  (^me tell.v ^you (my academic-major.n))
;  (^me ask.v ^you (id-of (your academic-major.n)))
;  ...
; But since the eventual EL representation allows for quoting, 
; we can make life easy for ourselves at first.

; I'm not sure if the speech generator makes use of upper-/lower-case
; distinctions. If so, we'll eventually have to use character-string
; output here, and a tokenizer that changes this to special Lisp atoms
; like |Hi| I |am| |Lissa|, ... (Using ~a rather than ~s in format
; statements will output such atoms without the escape characters.)
; Note: Lisp atoms with an internal or final '.' are ok, but commas
; and semicolons are not allowed without a preceding '\' or in a |...|
; context.

:episodes ( ; we start execution at this keyword
         ; (I've omitted other schema components for the time being.)
         ; Lissa's lengthy initial utterance may eventually be broken into
         ; a few higher-level (nonprimitive) actions such as introducing
         ; herself, the purpose and structure of the dialog, and the 
         ; explanation of the icons, with each nonprimitive action broken 
         ; down in turn into a number of (primitive) saying-acts.
