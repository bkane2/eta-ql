; An Eta dialogue focused around a patient-doctor interaction: after an introduction, the
; doctor may initiate conversation with a question. Otherwise, the patient has a list of
; questions on his agenda to ask the doctor (each one may spiral to various sub-dialogues
; before returning to the overall conversation track).
;
; 1. SOPHIE acted as a real cancer patient.
; 2. SOPHIE was able to show her concerns.
; 3. I did not understand what SOPHIE was saying about her prognosis.
; 4. I was given at one opportunity where SOPHIE needed a clarification.
; 5. I was able to discuss the treatment options with SOPHIE.
; 6. During the conversation I think there was chance of being empathetic.
; 7. I ended the conversation with a positive note without giving false hope.
; 8. I think SOPHIE understood her prognosis.
;
;
; palleative care
; doctor gives scan result, choice between chemotherapy A or chemotherapy B
; doesn't give choice of just focusing on comfort
; patients whose doctors offer comfort care as option more likely to take it
; should give the doctor an opportunity to present it as an option
; "what happens if I don't do chemotherapy?"
; "do you think chemotherapy's really going to help?"
; "do you think it's time for me to start thinking about comfort care?"
;
; prognosis:
; patient asks "what does this mean?"
; doctor says "let's try chemo" => doesn't even address question
; "how much of a difference do you think it'll make in terms of how long I live?"
; "how long do you think I have?"
;
;
; 1. Haven't slept well, have to take medication, keep waking up at night.
;
; 2. Just started on new pain medication recently, how long until I know if it's working?
;
; 3. In a lot of pain, Lortab isn't working. Need something stronger.
;
; 4. What do test results show, how do I interpret them?
;
; 5. What are my choices at this point?
;
; 6. What kind of time do you think we're looking at?
;
; 7. Previous doctor mentioned chemotherapy, mentioned to wait until after radiation. Do you think I need it?
;
; 8. I prefer to be comfortable at this point. Is hospice an option?
;
; 9. Haven't told family everything yet. What should I say to them?
;
; 10. Follow up

; TODO: the steps in this schema are represented as ((set-of ^me ^you) ...), and likewise for the schemas for each
; subdialogue, but perhaps it would make sense for them to be (^me ... ^you) instead.
