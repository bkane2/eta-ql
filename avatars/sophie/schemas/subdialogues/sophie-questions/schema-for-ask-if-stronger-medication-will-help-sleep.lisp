; TODO: although inquiring about a stronger pain medication might be the ultimate goal of the agent
; pursuing this line of questioning, it isn't the immediate goal, and so shouldn't be the immediate
; goal of this schema. However, this is currently necessary (until Eta is modified to support multiple
; inferences from the same gist clause) to prevent the agent from asking this question in the case where
; the agent already has "stronger" knowledge that they're being prescribed a stronger pain medication.
