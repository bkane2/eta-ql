;;
;; Contains the schema-based planning module used by Eta, built around the 'plan-step' structure
;; defined below. Each plan-step is a node in a plan polytree containing an episode name and
;; corresponding WFF, as well as possibly other information (probabilistic certainty scores,
;; obligations associated with the episode, etc.). Each plan-step is also marked as an intention
;; or expectation, depending on whether the episode is an action with Eta as the agent, or some
;; other type of episode.
;;
;; Each plan-step contains a pointer to a list of abstract plan-steps that it instantiates (parents),
;; as well as a pointer to a list of more concrete substeps (children).
;;
;; Functions described in more detail in their headers.
